When it comes to things your newborn needs, besides the obvious such as milk,nappies and clothes. Here is a list of 10 things that will make those newborn days easier.

#####1. Bassinet. 
In my experience a newborn baby doesn't like sleeping in big spaces like a cot (My baby is now 13 months and still refuses to sleep in a cot).

#####2. Baby swing. 
These will come in handy when your baby needs the comfort of rocking motions, but you have to do the dishes or other less fun jobs.

#####3. Changing table. 
These are great for c-section mamas as bending over to change your baby on the floor or bed can be very straining on your scar.

#####4. Sling/baby carrier. 
Baby's love being cuddled up to you and these are the best things ever if you need to get jobs done around the house and want to keep your baby close.

#####5. Diaper bag. 
You don't need an actual 'diaper' bag. But what you do need is a big bag one with a long strap so you can put around your pram. It needs to be big enough to fit all the basics such as nappies, wipes, spare clothes, bottles ect. 

#####6. Pram. 
Invest in an amazing pram. Trust me you wont regret it!! I bought a fairly cheap pram and hate it and am in the process of replacing it. When buying a pram think of these things... Can it fold down to fit in my boot? Can it accommodate a second baby? Is it suitable for the area i live?

#####7. Breastfeeding pillow. 
I cant stress enough how much i loved my breast feeding pillow. It made feeding my baby so much easier.

#####8. Car seat. 
This is pretty obvious, if you own a car and want to use it with baby your going to need one of these. Make sure you do your research and get one that is safe and also do your research in how to properly install it into your vehicle.

#####9. Nappy cream. 
Newborns need diaper changes often and they get nappy rash fairly easy if you don't apply any cream. There are plenty available that work wonders, we use sudocream and it works really well.

#####10. Baby bath. 
Also the essentials, such as a brush, nail clippers/scissors, body wash (something gentle and natural if you can). 

The list can go on and on, but these are the 10 top things i think will make life so much easier in those first few months.
